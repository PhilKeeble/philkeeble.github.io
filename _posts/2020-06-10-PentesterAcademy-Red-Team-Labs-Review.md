During the Great Lockdown of 2020, I decided to use the time saved not commuting by completing the red team labs offered by Pentester Academy. They offer three red team labs at the time of writing this post, which lead to the three qualifications CRTP, CRTE and PACES. I am happy to say I have passed all three and not many people have passed the PACES course so I am very happy with that. I wanted to write this post firstly as a sign of appreciation for the amazing courses, and secondly as a guide for someone considering which to start with. I will start at the easiest and work my way up them. 

## Certified Red Team Professional (CRTP)

CRTP is the first of the three red team courses offered. This course is aimed at beginners of Active Directory security and is beginner friendly. This course covers attacks such as kerberoasting, ASREProasting, SetSPN, Unconstrained Delegation, Constrained Delegation, ACL Abuse, Trustpocolypse attacks and cross forest trust tickets. This isn't an inclusive list but does give an idea of the types of attacks covered. If you are very familiar with these then it may be worth looking to do a more advanced one. If you don't know any of those then this is for you! 

### Structure

The lab for CRTP consists of a few domains across two forests. The network map can be seen on their website. The course is layed out in a way where no attack is more than 2 jumps away. I really like the for the first one because if you wanted to say, just jump in and try an unconstrained delegation attack, you would never have to go through a long chain of attacks to get there. This makes the CRTP lab ideal for trying the attacks. 

Included with CRTP is a full walkthrough of the lab including a pdf which shows all commands and output. All the tools needed are included on the machine, all you need is a VPN and RDP or you can do it all through the browser! This is amazing for a beginner course.

If that wasn't enough, their is 14 hours of content to watch explaining all the attacks fully and showing the attacks in the lab. As you can see, this is very beginner friendly and a great start for anyone looking to learn more about AD security.

### Exam 

The exam for CRTP is a 24 hour exam. During this time you need to compromise the environment (not going to put much info to avoid accidental spoilers) and write a report. This is a good exam and should be ok as long as you are comfortable with the material. 

One thing I will advise is to not just follow the walkthrough. When you do the CRTP lab with the walkthrough, do it again without. Do it again with different tools. Do it again with a command and control (C2) like metasploit or Covenant. Try alternate attack routes and bypass various restrictions. If you do all this you will have no problem at all in the exam and will have multiple options. 

## Certified Red Team Expert (CRTE) 

CRTE is the second of the red team courses. This course is aimed at an intermediate level. It contains similar attacks to CRTP but with a lot more MS-SQL attack potentials and a lot more logistical issues. Gone are the days where all attacks are only a hop away! You should be very comfortable with CRTP content before doing CRTE. 

### Structure

The lab for CRTE is the same in size to CRTP, as can be seen on their network maps on the website. The key difference is the extra challenges put in and the difficulties in the environment and some new attack paths. This gives a playground for a lot more MS-SQL attacks, privescs, command exec and persistance techniques which is lovely. It also includes attacks such as phishing and lots of various ways to bypass application whitelisting, double-hop restrictions etc. 

There are 60 flags to obtain within CRTE, 5 for each host. These typically include host based enumeration to find specific registry keys, data etc. A key focus on the flags was finding PII / PCI data such as emails and credit card details within databases which was a great touch and really useful for actual red teams where the objective is almost always PCI / PII. 

There is not walkthough for this course and the videos given are the same as before. Tools are also not included on the machine by default. This gives you the knowledge you need but you need to research and apply it appropriately, which I think is very nice. There are challenges within the lab that the course content will not help with, but I like that as it forces you to research which is a large part of pentesting. 

### Exam 

The CRTE exam is a 48 hour exam with a similar structure to CRTP, in that its attack the lab then report. If you have done the labs and are comfortable with that then you should be fine. I would recommend getting all flags (the support staff are amazing if you ever get stuck), and taking good notes. 

I would once again suggest doing the lab with powershell first, then with a C2 framework. I would also urge to find new routes and attacks and take full advantage of the playground you have as there arent many good ones around to learn this stuff.

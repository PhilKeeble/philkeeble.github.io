I'm Phil Keeble, a professional pentester and Red Teamer. I have done a lot of specialist work in finding new attacks for mainframes and other critical niche systems. 

This blog is a place for me to write about things i'm interested in and to put tutorials. I have my cheat sheets (cheats.philkeeble.com) which is aimed at providing quick commmand line options. This is a place to give more verbose explanations on topics revolving around offensive security. 

Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn (link at the side) and ask me questions if you wish.
